                <p id="texto-clases"><strong>Estudio Nómade</strong> was born in April 2014 in Buenos Aires in view of
                    the need
                    to generate a space to give classes, without having to follow the rules of the traditional studios
                    and to be able to
                    rethink new ways of connecting with the body.
                    One of the main pillars has always been to be in MOTION, first understanding movement as a vital
                    function of the body
                    and then understanding the movement as a philosophy of life, as a way of living.
                    The search for one's own balance that constantly adjusts and unadjusts.

                    This led me to realize that I needed to learn other ways of moving, other ways of living to
                    nurturing myself as a teacher and as a person. So I decided to get the studio in my backpack
                    go out to travel the world.

                    I was fortunate to be able to learn and teach in different places. <em> With Estudio Nómade
                        we traveled around
                        New Zealand, Tonga, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, India, France, Spain and Germany.
                        </em>
                        Each country gave me unique and unforgettable wisdoms and I am happy that everywhere I was able
                        to bring my own knowledge.

            <p class="texto-areas"> I´m <strong>Nati Ciraolo</strong>, born in the spring of the 90s.
                I have been studying dance since I was a child, at the age of 14 I started my career as a Musical Comedy
                Performer
                Musical Comedy and the Dance Interpreter career at the Caleidoscopio Institute. From that moment on
                I constantly trained in dance with various teachers in Argentina, such as Julieta Rodriguez Grumberg,
                Soledad
                Rodriguez Grumberg, Soledad Galoto, Emmanuel Ludueña, among others. Specializing from an early age
                in Contemporary Dance and improvisation. When I finished high school I started a career in
                Choreographic Composition at the U.N.A. at the same time I was training as a Pilates instructor at the
                Pilatesol Institute.
                In parallel to my university career and my work as a teacher, I participated in various artistic
                projects, presenting in 2015" Distorsión" my first dance theater play as director and coreographer
                premiered at La Lunares theater.

                Rishikesh, India in 2019.
                I trained as a Shiatsu masseuse to complement my knowledge about the body in Buenos Aires at the
                "Shiatsu por el Mundo" school. And in 2017 I became certified as a massagist in Thailand at the ancient
                school "Wat Pho".
                As a dancer I perfected my skills in Berlin and Toulouse with international teachers such as Christina
                Martzani, Marion Sparber and Alan Fuentes Guerra, among others.
                I currently work as a teacher, dancer and choreographer.
